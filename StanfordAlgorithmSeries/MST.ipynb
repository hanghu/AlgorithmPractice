OPTIONAL: For those of you seeking an additional challenge, try implementing a heap-based version. The simpler approach, which should already give you a healthy speed-up, is to maintain relevant edges in a heap (with keys = edge costs). The superior approach stores the unprocessed vertices in the heap, as described in lecture. Note this requires a heap that supports deletions, and you'll probably need to maintain some kind of mapping between vertices and their positions in the heap."

Each phase adds some edges to a tree-so-far and reduces the number of vertices in the graph (when there is only 1 vertex left, the MST is just the empty set). In a phase, we identify the cheapest edge $e_v$ incident on each vertex $v$ of the current graph. Let $F = \\{ e_v \\}$ be the collection of all such edges in the current phase. Obtain a new (smaller) graph by contracting all of the edges in FF --- so that each connected component of $F$ becomes a single vertex in the new graph --- discarding any self-loops that result. Let $T$ denote the union of all edges that ever get contracted in a phase of this algorithm. Is $T$ guaranteed to be a minimum-cost spanning tree? Prove it or exhibit a counterexample."
